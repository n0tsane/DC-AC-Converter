# DC-AC Converter
This project models a basic DC-AC Converter circuit in Simulink. The output is 50Hz Pseudo-sine signal. The specifications are as follows:

 - An H-Bridge circuit has been used to convert the DC voltage in Square wave AC voltage. The H-Bridge is modelled using **IRF540** power MOSFETs and **BC547B** fast-switching transistors.
 - The H-Bridge MOSFETs are controlled by clock pulses generated from an op-amp Astable Multivibrator.
 - Op-Amp integrators have been used to convert the square AC voltage into Triangular AC voltage.
 - RC networks have been subsequently used to convert the triangular waveform into pseudo-sine waveform.

## Details
The Converter diagram has been shown below.

The Astable multivibrator has been constructed using an op-amp (Finite Gain Op-Amp block in Simulink) with biasing voltages of +5 and -5 volts. and an 1uF capacitor. The values of R1, R2 and Rf are 5kOhm, 10kOhm and 6.213kOhm respectively. The multivibrator output is the following signal having an amplitude of 5 volts.

This multivibrator-produced signal acts as a clock pulse that controls the MOSFETs of the H-Bridge. The H-Bridge circuit diagram has been shown.

 - The H-Bridge has been designed using four IRF540 N-channel power MOSFETs. Although the freewheeling diodes have been shown in the circuit here, they are actually integrated into the MOSFET.
 - Two 10uF bootstrap capacitors have been used, along with fast-switching BC547B transistors (h_fe = 200-450, have been considered as 250 here), for the requisite bootstrap networks. Both the Rb values are 10kOhm, while the Rc values are 1kOhm.
 - One op-amp inverter has been used to invert the clock signal input.

An integrator circuit has been implemented, along with a RC network which is intended to convert the input signal into the final pseudo-sine output.

## The outputs from the Multivibrator and the H-bridge are:

## Problems with the modelled circuit
This is an ongoing project and a few problems are yet to be solved to get the desired pseudo-sine output signal. 
 - It is seen here that the clock pulse generated by the astable multivibrator is not uniform, and thus the output waveform cannot be an uniform AC signal.
 - The H-bridge follows the multivibrator clock pulse faithfully.
 - There are problems regarding the op-amp integrator outputs. It is currently observed that the integrator only clamps the H-bridge output, instead of creating a ramp/triangular signal.
 - The wave shaper circuit creates a pseudo-sine wave if supplied with a proper triangular wave input.

### This project shall be updated from time to time as and when the issues are solved.
